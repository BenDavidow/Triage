      <p>This visual breaks down the impact of reducing consumption of different animal foods. The sliders begin at an average American's consumption level of each food. Adjust the amount consumed of different foods and the corresponding amount of annual suffering caused will display on the right. If, for example, you drag eggs half way down, that equals a person splitting his or her egg consumption in half, and you'll see the color that represents eggs (purple) adjust on the right. By hovering over the impact bars, you can see the impact of each food in more detail. </p>

    <div id="about">
      <p>Why is chicken consumption responsible for so much suffering? Because chickens are so much smaller than cows and pigs. To get the same amount of meat that can be obtained from a single cow (or four pigs), more than 200 chickens must be killed. Thatâ€™s why, despite the fact that people eat almost as much pork and beef as they do chicken, they eat many, many more chickens than they do cows or pigs. What's more, chickens (both raised for meat and eggs) endure particularly severe mistreatment on factory farms. As Nick Cooney and I explain <a href="http://studentsforanimalrights.blogspot.com/2013/02/bowling-without-blindfolds-how-we-can.html">here</a>, we reduce more suffering and protect more animals from harm when we focus our outreach on chicken and eggs.</p>
